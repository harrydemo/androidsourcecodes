Random Ideas
------------

Tap & hold in the book view --> open book info dialog

"menu" items must have icons

Re-order menu items:
    -- library
    -- navigate
    -- find
    -- view
    -- preferences (directly to the preferences dialog)
    -- more \/ (does not currently exist)
        (put some items if we have more :))

'navigate' menu item:
    if table of contents exists:
        +-------------------+
        |   .  .  .         |
        | table of contents |
        |   .  .  .         |
        +-------------------+
        | to begn | to end  |
        +-------------------+

    if table of contents does not exist:

        +-------------------+
        | to begn           |
        +-------------------+
        | to end            |
        +-------------------+

(as discussed)
    -- add page # to the status bar; show only when the application is active

New Library view:
    -- four tabs: recent, tags, authors, network
        (menu allows to add the book)
    -- books are shown as a list of

        +--+------------------------+
        |II|<b>Title</b>            |
        |II|<small>Author(s)</small>|
        +--+------------------------+

       (II is an icon 60x35)

       clicking on the book (in recent, tags, authors) opens it
       tap & hold opens the book information dialog

    -- network page is a bit different
        (needs to be designed)

Submit bug report directly from the application :)

(Until it's implemented globally) Check for updates

Automatic text orientation to be done configurable

Process +/- volume control differently.  Options:
    -- increase/decrease font size?
    -- page up/down

Implement ZLAndroidImageData differently:
    -- lazy load
    -- convert picture into the required size
