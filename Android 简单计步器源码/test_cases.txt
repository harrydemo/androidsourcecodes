Start app, press HOME. Service icon should be in the notification bar.
Start app, quit, start again. Service icon should appear and counters should work.

Given the app is counting steps
When I start the app from the IDE (so it's killed without running any callbacks)
And I press HOME
Then I should see the service icon in the notification bar.
