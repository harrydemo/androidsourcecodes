This is the su binary for Superuser on Android.

Any app that requires root access must call this binary in order to be given root access.

Branches for this repo support the following Android versions:

 - legacy
   - cupcake
   - donut

 - master
   - eclair
   - froyo
   - gingerbread
   - honeycomb*

Branches marked with '-dev' are in work and should probably not be used. I will push to those channels as I develop new versions so they may be broken from time to time.

* I have yet to personally test superuser on any honeycomb devices, therefore I cannot guarantee it's compatibility
