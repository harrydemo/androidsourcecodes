    <string name="help_master">At Master level, the board edges wrap around;
cells on the right edge connect to those on the left edge, and vice
versa.  Similarly for the top and bottom edges.</string>

    <string name="help_insane">At Insane level, the board edges wrap around;
cells on the right edge connect to those on the left edge, and vice
versa.  Similarly for the top and bottom edges.  But in addition, in
cells with 3 or 4 connections, the wiring is invisible.  Good luck!</string>
