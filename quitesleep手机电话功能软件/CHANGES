Beta v1.1 is already released in Android Market, and there are updated the code 
in the Mercurial repository, the tarball package, api doc, and ready for install Android .apk

Bugs fixed:
1- Fix application died internally and produced malfunction. QuiteSleep now runs 
much better (very much).
2- Fix send SMS messages, note that the history show the sms shipment try, 
not indicates if the shipment/delivery was right.
3- Fix several internal function like as thread and services uses.

Important Note: not is a bug, but depends your mobile activity, one blocked 
incoming call could be sound < 1 second, and then silent the call. Not is 
QuiteSleep fault, is due, as I say, to the mobile activity.
