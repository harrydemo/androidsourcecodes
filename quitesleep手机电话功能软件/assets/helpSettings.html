        <li><h4>Block configuration (new in QuiteSleep 2.0!!)</h4></li>
        This section is one of the most important. Here you can choose your
        best block type in one second, you can choose between:
        <p></p>
        <ol type="1">        
        <li><i>Block all incoming calls</i></li>
        <li><i>Block only blocked contacts</i></li>
        <li><i>Block unknown calls</i></li>        
        <li><i>Block unknown and blocked contacts</i></li>
        </ol>
        <p></p>
        As you see with this options you can block any kind of call that you want.        
        
        <li><h4>Block type (new in QuiteSleep 2.0!!)</h4></li>
        Here you can choose between block the incoming call by two different ways:
        <p></p>
        <ol type="1">        
        <li><i>Silent the incoming call:</i></li>
        When QuiteSleep detect any incoming call and must block it, put the mobile phone
        is silent mode during the call, when the call is finish, QuiteSleep put
        the mobile phone into normal mode.
        <p></p>
        Be aware that if you put your mobile phone into silent, when you receive a call
        and QuiteSleep blocking it, when finish it, QuiteSleep put the mobile phone
        into normal mode, so your previous mode, silent, will be changed.  
        <p></p>              
        <li><i>Block the incoming call:</i></li>
        By this way, when arrives an incoming call and QuiteSleep must block it, the app
        do the hang up action, so the incoming call will be stop.
        <p></p>
        This action is "more hard" by the way the user will be received a cut in its call.
        <p></p>
        Be aware that this new feature is developed without use of Android SDK, so could
        be running bad in some mobile phones or Android versions.
        This feature have been proved in Nexus One with Android 2.0 to 2.2 and runs very well.
        </ol>
        <li><h4>Start/stop QuiteSleep service</h4</li>
        With this button, you will can switch on/off QuiteSleep service, so when you want that
        QuiteSleep must be run, switch on this button (a notification will appear on the status
        bar) or switch off QuiteSleep service (then the notification on status bar will be disappear).
      </ul>
