SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR for ANDROID

1. What is it?
SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR for ANDROID is a scientific calculator for the Android
platform.

2. Current state.
For now, it is a prototype.

Current features:
 - Exact computation of scientific expressions (functions of the Java Math
   library).
 - Basic plotting.
 - Auto-completion of input expressions.

Planned features:
 - Better documentation.
 - Testing.
 - Better UI.
 - Pretty print.
 - Symbolic calculus.
 - Possibility to program the calculator.
 - Fetching programs on a repository over the web.
 - Importing data for plotting, statistical computations...
 - Exporting data for use with other applications...

3. How to build it?
The project has been built with the Android Eclipse plugin. Here are the
instructions to build it.

 - Make sure your Eclipse installation is Android-enabled.
 - Import the project.
 - Update the Reference Libraries with the CUP Runtime library in
   Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries > Add external JAR.
   The library can be found here:
   http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/
 - Run!

If you are interested to work on the parsing of the expressions, you will need
CUP and JFLEX. The projects can be respectively found here:
 - http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/
 - http://jflex.de/
The .lex and .cup files are in com.google.calculator.parser.
