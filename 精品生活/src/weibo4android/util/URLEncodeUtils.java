		 * The list of characters that are not encoded has been determined as
		 * follows:
		 * 
		 * RFC 2396 states: ----- Data characters that are allowed in a URI but
		 * do not have a reserved purpose are called unreserved. These include
		 * upper and lower case letters, decimal digits, and a limited set of
		 * punctuation marks and symbols.
		 * 
		 * unreserved = alphanum | mark
		 * 
		 * mark = "-" | "_" | "." | "!" | "~" | "*" | "'" | "(" | ")"
		 * 
		 * Unreserved characters can be escaped without changing the semantics
		 * of the URI, but this should not be done unless the URI is being used
		 * in a context that does not allow the unescaped character to appear.
		 * -----
		 * 
		 * It appears that both Netscape and Internet Explorer escape all
		 * special characters from this list with the exception of "-", "_",
		 * ".", "*". While it is not clear why they are escaping the other
		 * characters, perhaps it is safest to assume that there might be
		 * contexts in which the others are unsafe if not escaped. Therefore, we
		 * will use the same list. It is also noteworthy that this is consistent
		 * with O'Reilly's "HTML: The Definitive Guide" (page 164).
		 * 
		 * As a last note, Intenet Explorer does not encode the "@" character
		 * which is clearly not unreserved according to the RFC. We are being
		 * consistent with the RFC in this matter, as is Netscape.
